4 different concrete tests were selected from the fresh and hardened concrete tests. 
V-funnel, T50 and slump-flow tests used to determine fresh concrete performance and concrete compressive strength tests used to determine the performance of hardened concrete were used. 
The data sets used were obtained from our own experiments and theses and articles obtained from the literature. 
60 data sets were used in the models designed for V-funnel, 108 data sets in the model designed for T50, 122 data sets in the model designed for slump-flow, and 67 data in the model designed for compressive strength.

The inputs are as follows
X1: cement (C)
X2: silica fume+silica powder+stone fume(S) 
X3: fly ash (FA) 
X4: maximum aggregate size (Dmax)
X5: fine aggregate (Fi) 
X6: coarse aggregate (CA) 
X7: water (W) 
X8: chemical additive (A) 
X9: amount of steel fiber (StF) 
X10: diameter of steel fiber (FD) 
X11: length of steel fiber (FD)

The output are as follows
Y1:  v-funnel (VF) 
Y2:  T50
Y3:  slump-flow (SF)
Y4:  compressive strength (Fc)
